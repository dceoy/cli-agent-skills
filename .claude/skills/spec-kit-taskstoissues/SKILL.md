# Spec-Kit Tasks to Issues

Convert tasks.md into GitHub issues with proper dependencies, labels, and organization. This is an **optional step** after spec-kit-tasks for teams using GitHub project management.

## When to Use

- After creating tasks.md with `spec-kit-tasks`
- Team uses GitHub Issues for task tracking
- Want to leverage GitHub Projects, milestones, or automation
- Need to assign tasks to team members
- User asks to "create issues" or "push to GitHub"

## What It Does

Creates GitHub issues from tasks.md with:

1. **One issue per task** (preserves task IDs)
2. **Dependency relationships** (using task lists or issue links)
3. **Labels** (by user story, phase, priority)
4. **Milestones** (by feature or sprint)
5. **Proper organization** (maintains task ordering)

## Prerequisites

**Required:**

- tasks.md exists (created by `spec-kit-tasks`)
- Git repository with GitHub remote
- GitHub MCP server configured and authenticated
- Repository write access

**Validation:**

```bash
# Check tasks.md exists
.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks

# Verify GitHub remote
git config --get remote.origin.url
# Must return github.com URL
```

## Basic Usage

### Step 1: Load Tasks

Run prerequisites check:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks
```

Provides:

- `FEATURE_DIR` - Feature directory path
- `AVAILABLE_DOCS` - List of available artifacts
- Tasks file path

### Step 2: Verify GitHub Remote

**CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK:**

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

**ONLY proceed if:**

- URL contains `github.com`
- Repository matches intended target
- You have write permission

**NEVER create issues in wrong repository!**

### Step 3: Parse Tasks

Extract from tasks.md:

- **Task ID** (T001, T002, etc.)
- **Description** with file path
- **Phase** (Setup, Foundation, User Story X)
- **User Story label** ([US1], [US2], etc.)
- **Parallel marker** ([P])
- **Dependencies** (from task order and phase structure)

### Step 4: Create Issues

For each task, use GitHub MCP server:

```markdown
Title: [T001] Create project structure per plan.md

Body:
**Phase:** Setup
**Story:** N/A
**File:** Project root
**Parallelizable:** No

## Description

Create project structure per plan.md

## Dependencies

- None (first task)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Directory structure matches plan.md
- [ ] All required files initialized

---

_From Feature: [Feature Name]_
_Task ID: T001_
```

**Issue metadata:**

- **Labels:** `phase:setup`, `feature:[name]`, `task`
- **Milestone:** Feature milestone (if exists)
- **Assignee:** None (unless specified)

### Step 5: Link Dependencies

**Dependency strategies:**

**Option A - Task Lists (recommended):**

For dependent tasks, add to issue body:

```markdown
## Blocked By

- [ ] #123 (T004 Create User model)
- [ ] #124 (T005 Create database migration)
```

**Option B - Issue References:**

Use GitHub's dependency syntax (if available):

```markdown
Depends on #123, #124
```

**Option C - Labels:**

- `blocked` - Has unresolved dependencies
- `ready` - All dependencies resolved

### Step 6: Organization

**Phase-based milestones:**

- Milestone: "Setup & Foundation" (Phase 1-2)
- Milestone: "US1 - User Registration" (Phase 3)
- Milestone: "US2 - User Login" (Phase 4)

**Labels by category:**

- `phase:setup`, `phase:foundation`, `phase:us1`, etc.
- `parallel` - Can run concurrently with others
- `test` - Test task
- `feature:[name]` - Feature identifier

**Projects:**

If GitHub Project exists, add issues to project board in "To Do" column.

## Output Format

### Issue Title Format

```
[T001] Task description from tasks.md
```

Keep original task description, prefix with task ID.

### Issue Body Template

```markdown
**Phase:** [Phase Name]
**Story:** [US1] or N/A
**File:** [Specific file path from task]
**Parallelizable:** Yes/No

## Description

[Full task description]

## Dependencies

[List of blocking tasks with issue links]

## Acceptance Criteria

[Extracted from tasks.md or generated]

## Related Artifacts

- Spec: [link to spec.md on branch]
- Plan: [link to plan.md on branch]
- Tasks: [link to tasks.md on branch]

---

_Feature:_ [Feature Name]
_Task ID:_ [T001]
_Generated by spec-kit-taskstoissues_
```

## Best Practices

✅ **DO:**

- Verify GitHub remote before creating issues
- Preserve task IDs in issue titles
- Link dependencies explicitly
- Use labels for organization
- Include artifact links in issue body
- Create milestone per user story

❌ **DON'T:**

- Create issues in wrong repository (validate remote!)
- Skip dependency linking
- Lose task ID mapping
- Forget to add feature label
- Create duplicate issues (check first)

## Example Workflow

```
Input: tasks.md with 30 tasks across 5 phases

1. Validate prerequisites:
   - tasks.md exists ✅
   - GitHub remote: git@github.com:user/repo.git ✅
   - GitHub MCP configured ✅

2. Parse tasks:
   - Phase 1 (Setup): T001-T003 (3 tasks)
   - Phase 2 (Foundation): T004-T006 (3 tasks)
   - Phase 3 (US1): T007-T014 (8 tasks)
   - Phase 4 (US2): T015-T022 (8 tasks)
   - Phase 5 (US3): T023-T030 (8 tasks)

3. Create milestones:
   - "Setup & Foundation"
   - "US1: User Registration"
   - "US2: User Login"
   - "US3: Password Reset"

4. Create issues:
   - Issue #101: [T001] Create project structure
     - Labels: phase:setup, feature:auth, task
     - Milestone: Setup & Foundation
     - Dependencies: None

   - Issue #102: [T002] Install dependencies: bcrypt, jsonwebtoken
     - Labels: phase:setup, feature:auth, task, parallel
     - Milestone: Setup & Foundation
     - Dependencies: #101 (T001)

   - Issue #103: [T007] Create registration endpoint
     - Labels: phase:us1, feature:auth, task, parallel
     - Milestone: US1: User Registration
     - Dependencies: #104 (T004 User model), #105 (T006 JWT util)

5. Report:
   - Created 30 issues (#101-#130)
   - Created 4 milestones
   - Applied 8 unique labels
   - Linked 45 dependency relationships
   - View: https://github.com/user/repo/issues?q=label:feature:auth
```

## Dependency Mapping

### From Task Order

Tasks in same phase with sequential IDs often have dependencies:

```markdown
- [ ] T007 Create registration endpoint
- [ ] T008 Implement email validation
- [ ] T009 Hash password with bcrypt
- [ ] T010 Generate JWT token after registration
```

**Dependency inference:**

- T008 → depends on T007 (validation used by endpoint)
- T009 → depends on T007 (hashing used by endpoint)
- T010 → depends on T009 (token needs user created)

### From Phase Structure

All tasks in Phase 3 depend on Phase 2 completion:

- Phase 3 tasks → blocked by all Phase 2 tasks

### From [P] Markers

Tasks marked [P] in same phase can run in parallel (no dependencies):

```markdown
- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Unit test: Email validation
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Unit test: Password hashing
```

Both are independent → no cross-dependency.

## Label Strategy

### Standard Labels

Create these labels in repository:

**Phase labels:**

- `phase:setup` (gray)
- `phase:foundation` (blue)
- `phase:us1`, `phase:us2`, etc. (green)

**Category labels:**

- `task` (white) - All generated tasks
- `parallel` (yellow) - Parallelizable tasks
- `test` (purple) - Test tasks
- `blocked` (red) - Has unresolved dependencies
- `ready` (green) - Ready to start

**Feature labels:**

- `feature:[name]` (blue) - Feature identifier

## GitHub MCP Integration

### Using GitHub MCP Server

**Required tool:**

```yaml
tools: ["github/github-mcp-server/issue_write"]
```

**API calls:**

```javascript
// Create issue
github.issue_write({
  owner: "user",
  repo: "repo",
  title: "[T001] Create project structure",
  body: issueBody,
  labels: ["phase:setup", "feature:auth", "task"],
  milestone: milestoneId,
});
```

**Error handling:**

- Rate limiting → pause and retry
- Permission denied → abort with clear error
- Duplicate detection → check existing issues first

## Validation

Before creating issues:

- [ ] GitHub remote validated
- [ ] Repository write access confirmed
- [ ] No duplicate issues exist with same task IDs
- [ ] Milestones created (if needed)
- [ ] Labels exist in repository

After creating issues:

- [ ] All tasks converted (count matches)
- [ ] Dependencies linked correctly
- [ ] Labels applied consistently
- [ ] Milestone assignments complete
- [ ] Issue URLs captured for reference

## Next Steps

After creating issues:

- **Assign** issues to team members
- **Organize** in GitHub Project board
- **Track** progress via issue updates
- **Link** PRs to issues (closes #123)
- **Update** issue status as tasks complete

## Related Skills

- **spec-kit-tasks** - Creates tasks.md (prerequisite)
- **spec-kit-implement** - Executes tasks (alternative to manual)
- **spec-kit-analyze** - Validates task consistency

## Common Issues

**Wrong repository:**

```
CRITICAL ERROR: Git remote is not a GitHub URL
or points to wrong repository.

Current remote: git@gitlab.com:user/repo.git

Cannot create GitHub issues. Verify remote:
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

**Missing GitHub MCP:**

```
GitHub MCP server not configured or not authenticated.

Setup instructions:
1. Install GitHub MCP server
2. Configure with personal access token
3. Test with: gh auth status
```

**Duplicate issues:**

```
Warning: Issues already exist with task IDs T001-T010.

Options:
1. Skip existing issues
2. Update existing issues
3. Abort (recommended)

Proceed? [y/N]
```

**Rate limiting:**

```
GitHub rate limit exceeded: 60 requests/hour

Created 45/100 issues. Pausing...
Will resume in 15 minutes.

Created issues: #101-#145
Remaining tasks: T046-T100
```

## Tips for Effective Issue Creation

1. **Validate first** - Always verify GitHub remote
2. **Batch wisely** - Create issues in groups, handle rate limits
3. **Use templates** - Consistent issue body format
4. **Link artifacts** - Include spec/plan/tasks links
5. **Enable automation** - Use GitHub Actions to auto-label, assign
6. **Track mapping** - Save task ID → issue number mapping

## Alternative: Manual Issue Creation

If GitHub MCP unavailable, generate CSV for bulk import:

```csv
Title,Body,Labels,Milestone
"[T001] Create project structure","Phase: Setup...","phase:setup,task","Setup & Foundation"
"[T002] Install dependencies","Phase: Setup...","phase:setup,parallel,task","Setup & Foundation"
```

Import via GitHub UI: Repository → Issues → Import issues

## Safety Checks

**Before ANY issue creation:**

```bash
# 1. Verify remote
REMOTE=$(git config --get remote.origin.url)
if [[ ! "$REMOTE" =~ github\.com ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: Not a GitHub repository"
  exit 1
fi

# 2. Extract owner/repo
# git@github.com:owner/repo.git → owner/repo
# https://github.com/owner/repo.git → owner/repo

# 3. Confirm with user
echo "Will create issues in: $OWNER/$REPO"
echo "Proceed? [y/N]"
read -r response
```

**NEVER skip these checks!**

**Remember**: GitHub issues are public (unless private repo). Ensure no sensitive information in task descriptions. Always validate repository before creating issues.
